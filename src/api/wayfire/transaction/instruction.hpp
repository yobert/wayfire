/**
 * A single instruction which is part of a transaction.
 * The instruction can change one or more states in Wayfire.
 *
 * The instruction lifetime is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Instruction is created and added to a transaction.
 * 2. Instruction is marked as pending. This means its transaction has been
 *   added to the queue of pending transactions, and will eventually be
 *   applied.
 * 3. Instruction is committed when its transaction is committed. This means
 *   that Wayfire is waiting for clients or other entities to become ready to
 *   apply the transaction.
 * 4. Instruction becomes ready (e.g. client responds with a new buffer), and
 *   'ready' is emitted.
 * 5. Instruction is applied when all instructions in its transaction are
 *   ready. Note that this can happen even before the instruction is ready, in
 *   case of a timeout. In this case, the instruction implementation determines
 *   the best course of action.
 *
 * If at any point the instruction becomes impossible to apply (e.g. view is
 * unmapped, output becomes destroyed, etc.), the 'cancel' signal should be
 * emitted on the instruction.
