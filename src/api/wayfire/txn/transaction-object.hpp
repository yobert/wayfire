 * A transaction object participates in the transactions system.
 *
 * Transaction objects usually have double-buffered state, which may not be applicable immediately, that is,
 * when a state change is requested, it takes some time until the changes can be applied. Sometimes, multiple
 * such objects are updated together in a single transaction, in which case the changes are to be seen as
 * atomic across all participating objects.
 *
 * The typical example of transaction objects are toplevels, where changing for example the size of the
 * toplevel requires cooperation from the client, and therefore cannot be done instantaneously.
 *
 * When speaking about transaction objects, they usually have three different types of state: current,
 * committed and pending. Current state is what the object currently is configured as, committed state is a
 * state which will soon be current (e.g. changes are underway), and pending are changes which have been
 * planned for the future, but execution has not started yet.
